I am an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam, a member of the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/), the lab manager of the [UvA-Bosch Delta Lab 2](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/), and an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) member.

My research interests span approximate statistical inference, uncertainty quantification, causality and machine learning, as well as their application to the sciences. I am currently working on generative models (diffusions, normalising flows, generative flow networks, ...), approximate inference (variational and Monte Carlo methods), probabilistic modelling (Gaussian processes, chemistry and finance applications, ...), uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing (E-values, conformal prediction, ...).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist with David Blei at the Data Science Institute, Columbia University. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Linköping University, advised by Fredrik Lindsten and Thomas Schön.
