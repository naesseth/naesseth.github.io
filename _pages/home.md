I’m an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam and a member of the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/). My research interests include approximate statistical inference, uncertainty quantification, causality and artificial intelligence as well as their application to the life sciences and economics.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist with David Blei at the Data Science Institute, Columbia University. I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering at Linköping University, advised by Fredrik Lindsten and Thomas Schön.
