The lab will attend [AABI](https://approximateinference.org/) and [ICML](https://icml.cc/) July 21-27 in Vienna, Austria. We will present several exciting contributions:

* [Neural Diffusion Models](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32683) (ICML conference)
* [Equivariant Neural Diffusion for Molecule Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3iih8PGAH7) (AI4Science workshop)
* [Fast yet Safe: Early-Exiting with Risk Control](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bNKXVR4wLY) (SPIGM/ES-FOMO-II workshop)

Reach out if you would like to chat about probabilistic machine learning, generative modelling, uncertainty quantification, or their application to the sciences!
