Decisions for [AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2025/) are out! The lab and collaborators are excited to present 2 (out of 2!) accepted papers:

* [Max-Rank: Efficient Multiple Testing for Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10900)
* Variational Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo for Bayesian Phylogenetics in Hyperbolic Space

Stay tuned for code and camera-ready versions!
