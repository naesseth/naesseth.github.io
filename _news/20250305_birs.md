Excited to attend the [BIRS Workshop: Efficient Approximate Bayesian Inference](https://www.birs.ca/events/2025/5-day-workshops/25w5335) next week to discuss approximate inference on the panel for Challenges & Opportunities in VI, and give a talk on our latest work on [SDE Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02472)!
