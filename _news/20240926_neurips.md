Decisions for [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) and [ICML](https://icml.cc/) are out! The lab and collaborators are excited to present no less than 5 (out of 5!) accepted papers:

* [Neural Flow Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12940)
* [Equivariant Neural Diffusion for Molecule Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=3iih8PGAH7)
* [Fast yet Safe: Early-Exiting with Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20915)
* [VISA: Variational Inference with Sequential Sample-Average Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09429)
* [Variational Flow Matching for Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04843)

Stay tuned for camera-ready versions and code!
