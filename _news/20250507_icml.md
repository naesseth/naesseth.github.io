Decisions for [ICML](https://icml.cc/) are out! The lab and collaborators are excited to present 2 (out of 2!) accepted papers:

* [SDE Matching: Scalable and Simulation-Free Training of Latent Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02472)
* Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching

Stay tuned for code and camera-ready versions!
